# GMDH-GWO
This study applies deep learning to predict daily electricity consumption over a month. It compares artificial and hybrid neural networks, demonstrating that hybridization enhances forecasting accuracy. Specifically, the Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) are combined to optimize load prediction in water utilities.
